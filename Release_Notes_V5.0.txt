Change Description
==================

lr is the ACIS Operations  review load processing program. Updates were made to lr and to several of the
other programs lr executes.

lr, itself, was modified to fix an IF statement that incorrectly analyzed if a load was of the type TOO and the
continuity load is Vehicle Only. lr was also  modified to call the new run_models.py which replaces run_models.pl

The following updated programs are excuted by lr:

run_models.py was written to continue the conversion of load review programs from Perl to Python. run_models.py included
a new switch allowing for easier unit testing on existing Production loads.  No interface changes.

acisbackstop.pl was modified to eliminate false errors generated when calculating the time delta
between an observation's Stop Science command and the next command to change the Obsid.

Check_Power_Cmds.py was modified to be more efficient by avoiding the ACISPKT processing loop when processing a
Vehicle Only load.

Other updates includes fixing typos and making comments more clear.

Testing:
======== 

Unit tests were carried out by running  test scenarios on all the updated  programs except lr.

Then full regression tests were carried out by arranging for the updated lr to call the new
 programs on Normal, TOO, SCS-107-only and Full Stop loads and loads with and without Vehicle Only Continuity loads. ACIS-LoadReview.txt output files and
thermal model plots were compared and all differences were understood. 


The production loads involved were:
