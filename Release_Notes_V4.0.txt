Change Description
==================

The main drivers for this update are:

  1) Continuity load having the same load week name as the review load (e.g. SEP2121B SEP2021A)
     
     Prior to this update, the user did not specify the load letter for the continuity load in the lr
     command line. This prevented the prior load of the same load week as the review load from
     being specified as the continuity load.

  2) A full weekly load being built with both science and vehicle commands, the load is uplinked,
     but only the vehicle commands executed (e.g. JAN1722).

     The thermal models need to know that when assembling a load history, only the vehicle commands 
     should be included when reading ther continuity load.  The ACIS Ops Load Review software (lr) was
     modified to give the user the ability to specify that, when reading continuity loads, the thermal models
     should read the vehicle-only  VR*.backstop file.  The default is to read the CR*.backstop file.

     This is accomplished by adding a --VO VOC switch to the lr command line. If not used the default read of 
     CR*.backstop will be executed. If the switch is specified, it is first checked for legal values. If the value of
     VOC is supplied to the switch then the thermal models will read the VR*.backstop file. This is accomplished
     by appending "VO_" to the load type discerned by lr (Normal, TOO, SCS-107, FULL STOP).
     This load type is written out to the ACIS-Continuity.txt file, which is read by backstop history.

     This update must be done in concert with the update to Backstop_History as
     Backstop_History has been  modified to recognize the VO_ prefix and knows how to handle it.

Additional updates were made to lr:

  3) Fix the bug which incorrectly threw and error when checking for the "triplet" - a set of 3
     commands expected after the conclusion of the Perigee Passage inbound ECS measurement.
     Initially, lr expected the power command within the triplet to be WSVIDALLDN. Over time
     the triplet could contain WSPOW00000 and WSPOW0002A.

  4) A --nomodels option to lr and run_models.pl which tells lr to not run the thermal models
     This can be used to speed up lr regression tests when the modification does not affect the
     thermal models.

  5) Clarified the user prompts which, when the -break switch is used, determine what the
     load type is (TOO, SCS-107, STOP).

  6) Added comments and fixed typos

Testing:
======== 

The changes were tested by running the:

   JUL0821A
   SEP2021B
   OCT2521B
   OCT3021A
   JAN1822B
   JAN2422A

loads in test mode. Behavior checked both if a new switch was, and was not used (e.g. --nomodels and
--VO VOC). Also tested when a  continuity load had a letter attached to it and when it did not both in cases
where it was required (SEP2021B) and where it was not required. If not required output was the same
as in production.

All changes which affected thermal model output were tested with and without new switches for
all 4 load types (Normal, TOO, SCS-107, Full Stop).

Thermal models were run where the changes affect the ouput of the models such as SEP2021B and OCT2521B
Assembled history was correct. 

The output in the test directories was  compared to that in the production directories. All differences were
expected and understood.      


Interface impacts
=================

ACIS Ops lr user has new switches to use when appropriate.
