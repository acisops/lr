Change Description
==================

The main driver for this update is handling the circumstance where the Review load is a full science + vehicle
commands load, but we know - prior to the review - that only the vehicle load command set, in the
review load, will be executed. The new LR switch: VOR for Vehicle Only Review was implemented. The Focal plane
thermal model had difficulties with the -109 database searches when the Vehicle-Only portion of a full load was 
processed by lr (see FSDS-18).

The program which checks for power command timing errors had to be modified to handle loads without any ACISPKT commands.
Also the Check_Power_Cmds output messages were cleaned up and made more informative.

Testing:
======== 

The changes were tested by running these regression test loads:

DEC2418A
DEC2418B
MAY2620
AUG3120
SEP2021
OCT2821
OCT3021
JAN1022 
FEB1422

These test types included Normal, TOO, SCS-107 and Full Stop loads; loads with and without power commanding errors,
loads which were vehicle-only as built (e.g. MAY2620 and AUG3120), and loads which were built as full loads but 
only the vehicle commands were activated (e.g. OCT2821 and FEB1422), and loads which were not affected by 
Vehicle-Only Continuity or Review loads. In cases where there was no production case of a load type being executed as
a full Review load (science+vehicle) where the Vehicle-Only commands were executed, tests were run and checked by hand
(e.g. JAN1022). 

The assembled histories for OCT2821 and FEB1422 were checked by hand and these loads were added to the regression test suite. 
Tests were also conducted using acis_thermal_checl/pull/48 to assure that the problem was fixed and the results were correct.
Where applicable, thermal model output was checked. All differing results were accounted for: all tests passed.



Interface impacts
=================

ACIS Ops lr user has a new switch to use when appropriate VOR.
