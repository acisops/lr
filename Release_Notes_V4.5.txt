Change Description
==================

Additional tests were added to HRC_Txing_Check.py based upon the FEB0623T Test load.
These new tests include: missing SCS-134 activation, the command to end the HRC
observation occurs well after the ACIS Event Histogram Stop Science, and the ACIS
Event Histogram is never activated.  In addition the program structure was simplified
and an extraneous import eliminated.

In addition, Insert_Comment_In_ALR.py was slightly modified in order to
account for a corner case when inserting comments into the ACIS-LoadReview.txt file.

In both cases comments were updated and improved.

Testing:
======== 

Both unit and regression testing were carried out for each of the two programs.

Unit tests for  HRC_Txings_Check.py were carried out by running those programs on the
regression test loads (see below) independently from the ACIS load review program.
The output was checked against expected outputs.  Then regression tests were carried
out by running the updated program from the ACIS load review program and the results
checked to be sure they were correct and complete.

Unit tests for Insert_Comment_In_ALR.py were carried out by generating a list of comments
to be inserted in an ACIS-LoadReview.txt file and the resultant file checked for proper placement.
Output from the Check_Power, Window_Check, Idle Dwell and HRC-Txing Checks on all regression
tests confirmed that  Insert_Comment_In_ALR.py executes corectly.

The changes were tested by running these regression test loads:


DEC0522P - First HRC-Txings Test Load

DEC0522F,G,H - Created by ACIS Ops
                           DEC0522P backstop file was hand modified to test error handling
                           when an HRC Observation Event Histogram SI mode was loaded,
		           but an SCS-134 activation is missing or if an SCS-134 activation
		           occurred but no Event Histogram SI mode was previously loaded.
			   
JAN3023A - Production load with no HRC commanding

JAN3023T - Second HRC-Txings Test Load

FEB0623T - Third HRC-Txings Test load

All tests passed.
