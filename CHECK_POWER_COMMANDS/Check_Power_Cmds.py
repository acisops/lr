#  Check_Power_Cmds - Check the power command spacing in the load to see if the

#
#                     For the time being, this new file is kept separate from

#
#  Update: June 26, 2019
#          VERSION: 1.3
#          Gregg Germain
#          Fix the Rule #9 error in the DEC2418 load.
#             - The error is due to the fact that you really have to first
#               alter the state of the system when you process a command
#               before you check for timing errors.
#                  Files changed: Check_Power_Cmds.py
#                                 Rulesets.py
#                                 System_State_Class.py
#
# Update: February 22, 2021
#         Gregg Germain
#         - Part of the Feb 22 update to fix the 63 second erroneous violations
#         - Removed deprecated Chandra.Time
#         - Eliminated commented-out line
#
# Update: February 15, 2022
#          Gregg Germain
#          - Allow for the case of a Vehicle-Only Review load where there are no ACISPKT commands

Check Power Commands - Check the sequence of power commands and report any 
                       instances where the delays between power commands
                       and other ACIS commands are incorrect.

                       Also, make sure that if you are finished with the
                       inbound ECS run and you have executed the WSPOW00000,
                       that the WSPOW0002A command was issued one hour later.
 
    Usage: The tool requires that:

            1) You have already run That portion of lr which creates the 
               ACIS-LoadReview.txt file, and

            2) You are cd'd into the OFLS directory that you want to check.

python3 /data/acis/LoadReviews/script/CHECK_POWER_COMMANDS/Check_Power_Cmds.py

     Check_Power_Cmds.py can be run in test mode where the .ERRORS file is not copied over
     into the ACIS-LoadReview.txt file


     The Rules:

    1)  4 seconds (at least) between ANY two ACIS Commands
          

    2)  24 seconds between WSPOW00000 (Power *DOWN*) 
        and ANY ACIS command (built in SI mode)


    3)  63 seconds between any POWER *UP* command and ANY ACIS command
        (in SI mode)
           - Power up commands are WSPOW commands that has non-zero
	     hex values

    4)  3 minutes between the AA00000000 and the WSPOW00000 or WSPOW0002A


    5) Must be 18 seconds after a WSVIDALLDN
     There seems to be 18 seconds between WSVIDALLDN's and the next
     power up command when you are re-using an SI mode.

    If a violation of these rules is detected, the number of the rule 
    in the above list is included in  the violation message.

    Last state is used to determine if it's fruitless to keep running a
    rule set. Set it equal to the presetn state and then run some rules. 
    Then you check to see if the state changed. If it did, keep running the rules.
    If it did not, then stop.
