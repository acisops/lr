Change Description
==================

lr has been updated to call the new routine:

     Find_Idle_Dwells.py

The purpose of this routine is to scan the load being reviewed and
identify long dwells between ACIS Stop Science commands and
ACIS Start Science commands. This is in response to the
1DPAMZT Red Limit reached during the OCT3122 load.  There was
a long dwell between ACIS science runs with 3 FEPs on, and
at high pitch which caused the violation.

The routine will alert the ACIS load reviewer that there is a long
dwell between science runs so that the reviewer can double check to
determine if the dwell is safe.

Additional small changes to lr were made to remove extraneous print
statements and fix a typo in a print statement.

To support  Find_Idle_Dwells.py, the following utility programs were
added:

	 UTILITIES/Backstop_File_Processing.py
	 UTILITIES/Insert_Comment_In_ALR.py
         UTILITIES/OFLS_File_Utilities.py
	 UTILITIES/SIM_Class.py

Testing:
======== 

Both unit and regression testing were carried out

The changes were tested by running these regression test loads:

DEC0522 - Normal
NOV0822 - SCS-107
OCT3122 - Normal - long dwell that resulted in a 1DPAMZT red limit
                                 violation
OCT2722 - TOO
OCT2422 - STOP - Manuever-Only load

DEC0522 - Normal - Run as a Vehicle-Only load

All tests passed.
