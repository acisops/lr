Change Description
==================

This update includes changes to the Load Review check programs to add the 1DPAMYT thermal model in the
list of thermal models that lr runs, and automates a modification to the continuity load's ACIS-Continuity.txt file if
required.

A call to run the approved 1DPAMYT thermal model has been added to run_models.pl.

Occasionally an executing load will be interrupted by an SCS-107-only or Full Stop
after its follow on load was reviewed and approved. The follow on load can be, and has,
been uplinked but run as Vehicle Only, until a new Return to Science load is built, approved
and uplinked.

An example of this is the MAY0624 - MAY1324 - MAY1424 load sequence:

MAY0624 was running on the Spacecraft

MAY1324 load was reviewed and approved as a Full Normal foillow on to MAY06

Then the MAY0624 load was interrupted by an SCS-107

MAY1324 was uplinked but run as Vehicle only.

MAY1424 Return to Science load was built, reviewed, approved and uplinked.

If lr has determined that a sequence similar to the above has occurred, the Vehicle Only load's ACIS-Continuity.txt file
is modified with the interrupt type and the time of interrupt. This information is available in the NLET file.

This adjustment need only be done once: when the Return to science Review load is the A load.
So this functionality is only executed for A loads.

Testing:
======== 

The 1DPAMYT model addition was tested during each test for the ACIS-Continuity.txt modification
update.  The modified run_models.pl, which contains the added call to run the 1DPAMYT model, was used.
The validation plots were checked for accurate predictions. The creation and population of the out_dpamyt
subdirectory in the lr ofls directories was verified.

The program Adjust_ACIS-Continuity.py was tested stand alone on copies of production load
directories. 

The test loads were created by copying production loads into new subdirectories with new names
and lr was run against those loads.

The production loads involved were:

MAY0624A
MAY1324A and MAY1324B
MAY1424A and MAY1424B

The MAY1324 A and B load were run with the updated lr (given a different load name) to insure that Normal loads
are still reviewed normally with the Normal ACIS-Continuity.txt file created.  Then the MAY1424 A and B loads
were run with the updated lr (also given a different name). The expected modification to the MAY1324B ACIS-Continuity.txt
file was observed when the MAY1424A load was run through lr.  No change to the MAY1324B ACIS-Continuity.txt file was
obsereved for the lr run of the MAY1424B load, as expected.

Test load directories were also created where the Continuity load does not have an ACIS-Continuity.txt file to modify.
This tests the error handling portion of Adjust_ACIS-Continuity.py.

There are no recent examples of the MAY0624 - MAY1424 event sequence where the interrupt was a Full Stop.
Consequently in order to verify correct operation when a Full Stop did occur, a test version of the NonLoadTrackedEvents.txt
file was created and a STOP was substituted for the SCS-107 entry for the interruption of the MAY0624 load. The MAY1424 A
and B tests were re-run and the expected ACIS-Continuity.txt file update was observed.

All tests passed.
