Change Description
==================

The ACIS Ops Load Review software (lr) was modified to copy in the bright-source 
list (bright_xray.txt) at the time of lr execution, storing the version for 
reference sake in the ofls subdirectory.

This facilitates testing old load weeks, and allows comparison against any changes 
or developments in the X-ray transient sky after the time of load production.

that the bright_xray.txt file was copied into the ofls 
working directory.
