Change Description
==================

The ACIS Ops Load Review software (lr) was modified so that all backstop file 
processing tasks are completed before the thermal models are run

There are two primary functions of LR:

   1) Process the CR*.backstop file and make automated checks
   2) Run the thermal models.

There were backstop processing functions set to execute before and some after
the execution of the thermal models. With this change, all backstop functions
are completed prior to the thermal model execution.

That way, if there is a problem with the thermal models (SEP2021) all of the
backstop functions will be completed.
