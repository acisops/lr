Change Description
==================

This update includes changes to the Load Review check program HRC_Txing_Check.py.

HRC_Txing_Check.py:

The purpose of HRC_Txing_Check.py is to check the timing of ACIS and HRC commands during HRC science
observations and determine if any guideline has been violated.  This update includes processing the new
ACIS SI mode for use during HRC observations: H2C_0001B.  The program was updated so that if, in the
future, a new SI mode to be used when HRC is observing is introduced, the program does not need to
be modifed.  Instead a file needs to be created and another file updated.  New checks were added which
check the sequence of commands for an ACIS SI mode when HRC is observing.  The checks will generate
a warning  if a command from this sequence is missing or if another ACIS command has been inserted
in the midst of the sequence.

Testing:
======== 

Both unit and regression testing were carried out for each of the three  programs.

Unit tests for  HRC_Txings_Check.py and HETG_Check.py were carried out by
running those programs on the regression test loads (see below) independently
from the ACIS load review program. The output was checked against expected outputs.
Then regression tests were carried out by running the updated program from the
ACIS load review program and the results checked to be sure they were correct and complete.

The changes were tested by running these regression test loads:

 JAN3023
 JUL0323
 JUL2423
 NOV2023B - Re-run of the Production load.
 NOV2023X - Hand edited by ACIS Ops to introduce all possible ACIS/HRC SI modes that can
                     be used during HRC observations. No errors introduced.
 NOV2023 W,Y,Z - NOV2023X load hand edited by ACIS Ops to purposefully introduce errors into the loads.

All tests passed.
