This update eliminates the false error thrown when an HRC observation is preceded,
and followed, by an ACIS observation, and both of which uses the same ACIS SI mode.
Commenting was improved as well.

Testing:
======== 

Unit tests were carried out by running  test scenarios on the updated acis-backstop.pl program in isolation.

Then full regression tests were carried out by arranging for LR to call the new
acis-backstop.pl program on loads which contained no HRC observations, HRC
observations surrounded by ACIS observations which used different SI modes,
HRC observations surrounded by ACIS observations using the same ACIS SI modes,
Normal, TOO, SCS-107-only and Full Stop loads. ACIS-LoadReview.txt output files and
thermal model plots were compared and all differences were understood.


The production loads involved were:

OCT2124
OCT1324
SEP0924
AUG2924
MAY0624

All tests passed.
